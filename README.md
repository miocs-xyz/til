# Today I learned

---
Hello every one. My name is Julian Zhao.

I'm a programmer from Chinese. 

When I lived in Japan, I saw many people use Github to build their **Today I learned**.

And from today, I will build mine **Today I learned** for recording all technologies which I learned every day.

**Can't read English? Don't worry. We also have the other language:**

- [简体中文](README.zh_cn.md)
- [日本語](README.ja_jp.md)

Since December 2020. I started to learn the Rust programming language.

So, the main recode will be Rust until I mast it.

And you can found them here.
