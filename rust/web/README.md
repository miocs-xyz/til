# Build web applications with Rust

---
## Framework
There is a lot of web framework for Rust. I compare some of them and at last choose the actix_web framework for our development.
- [actix_web](https://actix.rs/)
  
But actix_web has no template engine built-in. So we should choose one. I will use askama for my development.
- [askama](https://github.com/djc/askama)

From now, I will use the frameworks listed above to develop a simple CMS system.
